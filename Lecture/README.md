## Presentation
`HPCC_Presentation.*`: Rmd and html files of the brief slides accompanying this tutorial. Formatting isn't great - some images might not show up.

`HPCC_diagram.jpeg`: Image from lecture depicting the layout of the HPCC. We start on our personal computer, log onto a gateway node, log onto a development node (can run jobs $leq$4 hours), and submit jobs to the clusters. (might not be in the slides)
