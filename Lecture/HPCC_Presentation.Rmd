# High Performance Computing 

![34963657.jpeg](34963657.jpeg)

---

# What does it mean for us?

- Can run long jobs on the HPCC without tying up personal computer
- Can run jobs in parallel
  - Bayesian often runs 3 chains. Each can be run simultaneously
- Huge datasets or processing that can't be done on a typical computer
  - Evolution, especially digital evolution
  - Large genetic sequences
  - Long Bayesian models
  - Jobs that take up to seven days

---

# Downsides

- Substantial learning curve 
    - Hopefully this document helps!
- Submitted jobs don't run immediately
  - Minutes to days. Generally not too long
- File transfer and storage can be challenging
  - GitHub and mapping your HPCC drive helps a lot
- Can be down for maintenance
- Changes in access pathways - i.e. authentication changes

---

# HPCC Availability

- PI must request account for researchers
  - [https://icer.msu.edu/users/getting-started](https://icer.msu.edu/users/getting-started)
- Some courses use the HPCC and create accounts
- All MSU researchers can access at no cost
- Buy-in program 
  - Priority access
  - Additional storage
  - Faculty buy hardware at cost, ICER maintains

---

# Accessing the HPCC

- Need a secure shell (ssh) to access
- [https://docs.icer.msu.edu/install_ssh_client/](https://docs.icer.msu.edu/install_ssh_client/)
- Terminal
  - RStudio or regular computer terminal (MacOS)
  - Fully command line access
- MobaXTerm
  - Can upload and download files using GUI or command line

---

# Accessing the HPCC

- Online browser access 
  - [OnDemand](https://cilogon.org/authorize?response_type=code&scope=openid%20profile%20email%20org.cilogon.userinfo&client_id=cilogon%3A%2Fclient_id%2F7f3abb985356946fa1f68d2de33720c4&state=yb9i3L-ZJJn71Hko9VBNDNnsTdA&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fondemand.hpcc.msu.edu%2Foidc&nonce=niAIr4gRyhHRhC0A1dzSIXmwnHqDT_O8ZHYrXYHZAMo&idphint=urn%3Amace%3Aincommon%3Amsu.edu)
  - Can upload and download files using Graphical User Interface (GUI; like RStudio)
  - Hosts RStudio sessions
  - Can run GUI programs like RStudio
  - Might not host everything
  - Recommended for getting started

---

# Mapping Home Drive

- Mapping a drive allows you to see your files in the File Explorer window
- Allows you to access your drive from your Terminal
- Can drag and drop files onto a mapped drive as long as you're logged into the HPCC on your Terminal (and sometimes VPN)
- Can be a pain to set up with authentication requirements, but once set up is usually good-to-go
- Samba (My current approach) [https://docs.icer.msu.edu/Mapping_HPC_drives_with_Samba/](https://docs.icer.msu.edu/Mapping_HPC_drives_with_Samba/)
  - Requires university IP address or VPN to access
- SSHFS [https://docs.icer.msu.edu/Mapping_HPC_drives_with_SSHFS/](https://docs.icer.msu.edu/Mapping_HPC_drives_with_SSHFS/)

# Troubleshooting

- HPCC Documentation: [https://docs.icer.msu.edu/](https://docs.icer.msu.edu/)
- System status
  - ICER Service Status [https://blog.icer.msu.edu/](https://blog.icer.msu.edu/)
  - Dashboard [https://icer.msu.edu/dashboard](https://icer.msu.edu/dashboard)
- Office hours on Teams
  - Monday and Thursday 1-2 pm

# Lab Notebooks

- Record of problem solving/workflows. My workflow is published on ICER's Lab Notebooks so that anyone can read it

- If you develop a workflow or any other material, can provide it to ICER to post here

- [https://docs.icer.msu.edu/Lab_Notebooks/](https://docs.icer.msu.edu/Lab_Notebooks/)

# Git and GitHub

- Git is open source version control software
- Several other software programs use Git, including GitHub
- Make repositories that contain everything you're using for a project
- Version control means that GitHub will record each of the changes you make to your files
  - Really helpful if you mess up and want to go back to a previous version
  
---

# GitHub and Collaboration

- Multiple users can have access to the same repository
- Can help in making sure that everyone has up-to-date files
- Sometimes painful if two people edit the same file simultaneously. Can be fixed, but is a little tricky
- Can be useful for class project settings 

---

# GitHub and RStudio

- Integrates well with RStudio
- RStudio's projects can be set up as their own Git repositories
- Accessible via Terminal tab next to the Console tab
- Accessible via the Git tab next to the Environment tab
  - Might be more user-friendly if using GitHub without the HPCC 
  - Can only access the working directory (not both working directory and y drive)
  - Terminal lets you have both working directory and mapped drive in one RStudio window

---

# Note: File Size Limitations

- GitHub is not great for many large files due to version control, since it stores copies of each change
- 100 MB limit
- GitHub Large File System exists, but does not work well if you're ever going to change your file. I don't recommend it
- [https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github)

---

# What if you have large files

- Upload or download onto HPCC manually
  - Upload or download buttons if interactive GUI
  - cp filename.ext with file paths if command line
- rsync.hpcc.msu.edu
  - [https://docs.icer.msu.edu/File_transfer/](https://docs.icer.msu.edu/File_transfer/)
  - Specific to file transfer
  - Requires SSH keys, not username/password  
- Globus
  - Great for large file transfer [https://docs.icer.msu.edu/Transferring_data_with_Globus/](https://docs.icer.msu.edu/Transferring_data_with_Globus/)
- Open Source Framework
  - [https://osf.io/](https://osf.io/)
  - Integrates with GitHub, sharable
  - Only for hosting, won't sync with HPCC

---

# GitHub Learning Curve

- GitHub has its own commands and functions
- Add, commit, push, pull, status
- Fantastic source for integration with RStudio: [https://happygitwithr.com/](https://happygitwithr.com/)
- General Git command line tutorial: [https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/gittutorial.txt](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/gittutorial.txt)
- Cheat sheet: [https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)

# RStudio

- Access hub for GitHub and HPCC
- My approach is to open three Terminal windows
  - One to transfer between GitHub and working directory
  - One to transfer between GitHub and HPCC mapped drive
  - One logged into the HPCC to run the code and submit jobs
- RStudio projects work well with GitHub repositories
- Support for multiple languages
  - R
  - Python
  - Stan (Bayesian)
  - Markdown
  - C/C++
- Already familiar
