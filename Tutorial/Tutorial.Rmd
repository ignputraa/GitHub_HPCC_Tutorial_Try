# Tutorial with the repository

This tutorial is designed for step-by-step editing of a GitHub repository and for learning how to submit jobs to the HPCC. The repository is meant to pick up at the end of HPCC.Rmd/md/html, once you have your computer configured to allow GitHub and RStudio to talk to each other and have the HPCC account mapped to your drive. You can also work through the exercises without the HPCC. 

## Put this repository on your computer

Fork the repository: Only owners of a repository can make changes. But if the repository is public, others can "fork" the repository. This creates a local copy on their GitHub that they can make changes to. Go to the main page of this repository. Above the bring green `<> Code` button, there are four buttons. The third says `Fork`. Click this button and make a copy of this repository in your account.
